        I will tell you about how Monday and Tuesday went of this week. On Monday morning I woke up and took a shower and got in my car and started to come to college. 
        It took a longer time than before, but it started, and I came to college. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I am free from college around 8:30 to 9:00 pm, and when I came to my car it didn’t open from the remote, I unlocked it with the key and then tried to start it but nothing at that moment all my friends had gone.
        I went to building 1L there was one of the security members I told him all the story and after like 15 to 20 minutes another member with booster and my car got started and I went home. At that point I had also order the booster from amazon which arrived around 8 Am on Tuesday morning. 
        Then I went to wash hounds from where I wash my batteries as well. They opened my old battery and replaced it with a new one, but the new one was big in size it won’t fit in my car. Then at that point I started my car the first time, but still I went to the auto zone. 
        They had the battery, but they didn’t have the tools to open the battery, and I came back home. Then I realized that the issue was not that my battery was dead the issue was that my battery terminals were rusty and when the wash hounds people opened the battery the rush went away and now my car starts perfectly fine.
