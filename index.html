        <p> 
            I am Arhab Zahid. I am an internation student. This is my 5th semester, and my junior year. 
            I am a Computer Science major. I have taken CSC 126, CSC 211 and CSC 220. In this semester I am takin CSC 221, CSC 326, CSC 228, CSC 225 and MTH 232.
            Now I will talk about my car and then about my planes. So, I own a 2012 V6 convertible Mustang and she is beauty and in a beast.
            It does not have the best milage but when it runs you get satisfied that you don't feel regret,
            and because I love it a lot, I call it my princess.
            I have a hobby which is on top of my hobby list, which is to Fly RC airplanes and own some collection of scale airplanes. I will give a table about some of my airplanes.
