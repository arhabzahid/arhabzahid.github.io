        <p> I am Arhab Zahid. I am an internation student. This is my 5th semester, and my junior year.
            I have a hobby which is on top of my hobby list, which is to Fly RC airplanes and own some collection of scale airplanes.
            I have taken CSC 126 2 times first time I didnt clear my class I don't why but thats the truth, then in second attempt i wasn't willing to take the class but it was a pre-req, so i took it and got B in it.
            After that class I took CSC 211 and CSC 220, That both class cleared in the first attempt got an A and B+ in those classes.
            I own 2012 V6 convertable Mustang and she is beauty and in a beast. I call it my princes.
